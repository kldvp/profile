<!-- 
    Layouts:
        layouts are templates that can be used by any page in your site and wrap around page content
        they are stored in a directory called _layouts
-->

<!-- 
    includes:
        navigate between pages
        navigation should be on every page, so adding it to layout template will be reusable
        however we can use includes to make it seperate file for navigation
        Includes are useful for having a single source for source code 
        that repeats around the site or for improving the readability. 
-->

<!-- 
    Data files:
        Jekyll supports loading data fron different file: yaml, json and csv
        They must be placed in a directory called _data
        data files are a great way to seperate content from source code and easier to maintain.
        jekyll makes available this data under "site.data.<file-name>"
 -->

<!-- 
    Assets:
        jekyll be default have support to scss files
        we can maintain assets/ for css, images & js files
 -->

<!-- 
    Blogging:
        in true jekyll style, blogging is powered by text files only.

        file name for blog post have special format
        -> <publish-date> <title>.<extension (html|md)>
